    "Usage": f"`{client.default_prefix}unit <src units> [dst units]`",
    "Arguments": "`src units` - Source units to convert from. Supports any units the Unix `units` command supports (a "
                 "*lot!*).\n`dst units` - (optional) Destination units to convert to.",
    "Description": "This units transforms one unit into another unit. The command uses the underlying `units` Unix "
                   "command, and supports over 3000 different units.\nIf destination units are not provided, the "
                   "source units will be converted into standard SI units.",
    "One argument usage": "`units 0.04128mi`\n`units 12d`\nWhen passing only one argument, the bot will convert the "
                          "given measurement into standard SI units.",
    "Two argument usage": "`units 41.28mi km`\n`units 12um 0.02mm`\nWhen passing two arguments, the format is `units "
                          "<src> <dst>`. This will convert the given measurement into the destination unit, if "
                          "possible. If two numerical measurements are provided, this performs a ratio comparison "
                          "instead (see below). Note that providing one measurement but with a space is interpreted as "
                          "attempting to convert a dimensionless number into a measurement, and will throw a "
                          "conformability error.",
    "Three argument usage": "`units 1.3 lightseconds m`\nWhen passing three arguments, the first two are interpreted "
                            "as the source measurement, which will be converted into the destination measurement given "
                            "by the third argument.",
    "Four argument usage": "`units 0.128 us 0.000000319 sec`\nWhen passing four arguments, the first two and the last "
                           "two are interpreted to be the source and destination measurements. With numerical values "
                           "provided for both, this will perform a ratio comparison (see below).",
    "Using temperature": "If it is desired to use temperatures, the temperature functions must be used: `tempC(1700)`, "
                         "`tempK(273.15)`, `tempF`, or `tempR`.",
    "SI conversion": "If a single unit is passed without a destination unit or measurement to convert or compare to, "
                     "then the provided measurement will be converted into standard SI/physics unit dimensions of "
                     "length (meters), mass (kilograms), and time (seconds).",
    "Comparing measurements": "It is possible to pass in two whole measurements in order to compare the two, assuming "
                              "they are of the same dimensions (ie. they are both mass, or velocity, or whatever). The "
                              "resulting scalar value is the ratio of how greater the first value is to the second "
                              "(eg. `units 5km 2.5km` returns 2.0, because 5km is twice as large as 2.5km). Using "
                              "units that cannot be compared results in a conformability error.",
    "Conformability errors": "When it is impossible to convert or compare the measurements given (eg. minutes into "
                             "kilometers), a *conformability error* will result. The two resulting values given are "
                             "the base SI units for both given measurements, as if you had performed the one argument "
                             "usage using it.",
    "Performing math": "The units command can perform rather complex math, by entering an expression to calculate in "
                       "the form of one argument usage. Trig functions are done in radians (as they rightfully "
                       "should), and proper evaulation order is followed.\nExample: `units 12+3/(2sin(pi/2))`",
